% Oct 2014

## Introduction 

This is an outline of what we will discuss

### Planning 

* The need for a plan
* Things to consider when planning
* Planning as writing schedule

### Referencing

* Why is referencing important
* The need for a consistent system
* The Harvard referencing system
	* Citations 
	* Bibliographic entries 
	* Examples of common types

## Planning

### Why do we need a plan?
<iframe width="350" height="240" src="https://w2.countingdownto.com/662521" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### What is a plan anyway?

* A calendar schedule for completing the tasks associated to the project.
* Make it detailed: week-by-week from now until submission.
* Keep it visible: wallchart? Google Calendar? Smartphone app?
* Have a flexible plan: allow it to change, incorporate new tasks, abandon unneccessary tasks,

### Most good plans focus on the tasks. What are the tasks?

* Reading
* "Doing the work"
	* Understanding new mathematics
	* Solving new problems / carrying out statistical analysis / OR analysis / mathematical modelling ...
	* Presenting material in different ways
* Writing 
* Coding
* Poster preparation
* Presentation preparation
* Constructing physical models
* ...

## Planning tools

* Various software tools/systems for project planning available
* Whether you need these requires some self knowledge/investigation:
	- are you naturally well organised?
	- do you find it difficult to remember and organise your schedule?
	- do you procrastinate a lot?
	
Some suggestions:

* a diary
* a wall lanner 
* [Getting Things Done](http://gettingthingsdone.com/)
* [Gantt charts](http://www.ganttproject.biz/), [Excel template](http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/templates/results.aspx?qu=gantt&ex=1#ai:TC102887601|)
* [Trello](https://trello.com/), a card based system
* ...

## Tasks: Reading

* Keep it active
* Test understanding: work on exercises, fill in missing details, gaps, ...
* Make notes as you read ...
* ... these notes become your first drafts

When reading mathematics books and papers be aware the different levels of understanding you might be after, i.e.
* complete understanding of all technical details and arguments,
* simply looking for the broad outline of the topic
* just looking for nice illustrative examples
* historical background details
* ...

## Tasks: "Doing the work"

* When does this happen?
	* In defined period, or throughout project?
	* Divide into smaller achievable tasks

## Tasks: Writing

### Your history

* How experienceed are you writing long pieces?
* How long ago was it?

### The writing process

* Recognise the need for drafting & re-drafting & re-drafting ...
* Don't try and make it perfect first time.
* From now have a draft Table of Contents and
	* use this to organise your approach,
	* use this as a menu to pick and choose writing tasks.

* You don't have to write from beginning to end.

* Writing throughout the project period allows you to 
	* get technical details down while they're fresh in your mind,
	* have a break from reading.

* Introduction chapter & abstract will probably be written near submission, as
	* you can't properly introduce what isn't already there.
	
* Have sources of feedback
	* Your own re-reading & proofreading
	* Friends and colleagues
	* Supervisor

## Tasks: Writing

### A useful exercise to help writing

I have found a daily writing practice (free writing) helps my 'serious' writing. This technique was popularised by [Natalie Goldberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Goldberg) amongst others.

* Do this regulary and ideally every day.
* Set timer for 10 minutes.
* Write constantly for these 10 minutes without stopping.
* Content, grammar, punctation, etc are not important.
* Write about mathematics, your plans for the day, reflections on yesterday, ...
* Do not stop writing. If you can't think of anything then ...

>I am sitting here and do not know what to write. I am sitting here and do not know what to write. I am
>sitting here and do not know what to write. I am sitting here and do not know what to write. I am 
>sitting here and do not know what to write. I am sitting here and do not know what to write. I am 
>sitting here and do not know what to write. I am sitting here and do not know what to write. I am 
>sitting here and do not know what to write.

This daily writing practice can be a good cure for procrastination and helps to clear the mind of distractions.

## Tasks: Coding

If you plan to include computer code in your report then it needs to be ...

* well structured,
* adequately commented.

Best done as you write the code?

## Tasks: Poster & presentation

* See later project talk

## The plan

* Your plan will need to incorporate all the relevant tasks in a realistic way.
* Beware other coursework deadlines and make use of quieter times.

Avoid the naive plan of 

* Do all the reading now ...
* ... and then do all the writing.

What are the drawbacks of this approach? 

A plan which mixes the tasks we've discussed throughout the project period will provide an interesting mix of different work activities and help you to make consistent progress on all fronts.


## Referencing

### The purpose of referencing 

Two of the main reasons are

* To give due credit to other authors for the use of their ideas.

* To allow your reader to investigate your work further by
	* checking your claimed sources,
	* finding out more about the ideas you refer to.

### Referencing systems

There are many systems for referencing in use. They combine brief **citations** within the text which refer to full **bibliographic** information about the sources which appears in a list of references at the end of the text and/or in footnotes at the bottom of pages containing citations. 

* *Numeric* reference systems are quite common in mathematics and involve a numbered list of references at the end of the text which are cited by number in the text.
 	* In widespread use by many books and journals.
	* But numeric citations convey no information and require interrupting flow of reading if any information about author or age of work is required.
	* Reference lists not always sorted alphabetically by author surname.

* *Author Date* reference systems use **citations** consisting of author(s) surname(s) and publication year which refer to full **bibliographic** entries which are listed at the end of the text, sorted alphabetically by the (leading) author's surname.
	* Requires slightly more effort to implement than numeric systems
	* But citations now convey relevant information
	* Reduces need to interrupt flow of reading
	* Reference lists are always sorted alphabetically

## The Harvard Referencing style

* You are required to use the Harvard reference style.
* Fully specified in the Faculty's [guide](http://www.library.mmu.ac.uk/helpsheet/mmuharvard1.php)
* Pay careful attention to the specific details re ordering, punctuation, use of italics etc and apply consistently.
