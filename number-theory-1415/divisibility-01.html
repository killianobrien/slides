<h1>NT&amp;C \\ Divisibility (sec. 2.1)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we introduce the divisibility relation of the integers. It accords exactly with our primary-school notions of one number <em>evenly dividing</em> another.</p>
<h3 id="definition-2.1-divisibility">Definition 2.1 (Divisibility)</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. We say that <span class="math">\(b\)</span> <em>divides</em> <span class="math">\(a\)</span> if and only if there exists an integer <span class="math">\(c \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\[ a = bc .\]</span> If this is so then <span class="math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c\)</span> can be referred to as <em>factors</em> or <em>divisors</em> of <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(a\)</span> can be referred to as a (integer) multiple of <span class="math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="notation">Notation</h3>
<p>We write <span class="math">\(b | a\)</span> to denote that <span class="math">\(b\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b \! \! \not | a\)</span> to denote that it does not.</p>
<h3 id="example-2.1">Example 2.1</h3>
<p>The integers <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(3\)</span>, <span class="math">\(5\)</span> and <span class="math">\(15\)</span> all divide <span class="math">\(15\)</span>, whereas <span class="math">\(10\)</span> is not divisible by <span class="math">\(3\)</span>.</p>

<h1>NT&amp;C \\ Divisibility (sec. 2.1)</h1>
<h3 id="theorem-2.1-properties-of-divisibility">Theorem 2.1 (Properties of divisibility)</h3>
<p>The divisibility relation enjoys the following properties:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>(<em>Reflexivity</em>) For all <span class="math">\(a \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a | a\)</span>.</p></li>

<li><p>(<em>Divisibility of linear combinations</em>) For all <span class="math">\(a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, if <span class="math">\(a | b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a | c\)</span> then for all <span class="math">\(n,m \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a | \left ( n b + m c \right )\)</span>.</p></li>

<li><p>(<em>everything divides <span class="math">\(0\)</span></em>) For all <span class="math">\(a \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a | 0\)</span>.</p></li>

<li><p>For all <span class="math">\(a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, if <span class="math">\(c \neq 0\)</span> then <span class="math">\(a | b\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(ac | bc\)</span>.</p></li>

<li>We will prove all of these.</li>
<li>Note that an integer <span class="math">\(z\)</span> has exactly the same divisors as its negative <span class="math">\(-z\)</span>. In order to avoid duplication we normally confine our attention to the divisibility properties of the positive integers.</li>

<h1>NT&amp;C \\ Primes (sec. 2.2)</h1>
<h3 id="definition-2.2-prime-composite">Definition 2.2 (Prime, Composite)</h3>
<p>An integer <span class="math">\(p &gt; 1\)</span> is <em>prime</em> if it has no positive divisors other than itself and 1. An integer <span class="math">\(n &gt; 1\)</span> which is not prime is called <em>composite</em>.</p>
<p>The list of prime numbers begins <span class="math">\[
2, \, 3, \, 5 , \, 7 , \, 11 , \, 13 , \, 17, \, 19, \, 23, \dots 
\]</span></p>

<p>Also look at relevant Matlab commands</p>

<p>We shall prove he following theorem later in the course.</p>
<h3 id="theorem-fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic">Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic)</h3>
<p>Every positive integer <span class="math">\(n\)</span> factors into a product of primes <span class="math">\[
n = p_1^{\alpha_1} p_2^{\alpha_2} \dots p_r^{\alpha_r}, \quad \text{$p_i$ prime, $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{Z}^+$}
\]</span> and this factorisation is unique up to the order in which the primes are written down.</p>
<p>Most people's intuition about the integers agrees with this result and the existence of such prime factorisations can be proved now and follows by recursively applying the definition of prime/composite to <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and using the transitivity of divisibility. But the proof of the uniqueness of these factorisations requires some more theory to be developed.</p>
</div><div id="ntc-common-divisors-sec.-2.3" class="slide section level2">
<h1>NT&amp;C \\ Common divisors (sec. 2.3)</h1>
<p>Relationships between the divisibility of different integers is investigated using the concept of common divisors.</p>
<h3 id="definition-2.3-common-divisor">Definition 2.3 (Common divisor)</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. An integer <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is a <em>common divisor</em> of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(c\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="definition-2.4-greatest-common-divisor">Definition 2.4 (Greatest common divisor)</h3>
<p>By the well-orderedness of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> there exists a <em>greatest common divisor</em> of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. This is denoted <span class="math">\(\text{gcd}(a,b)\)</span>. Note that some authors use a minimalist notation of <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span> to denote the greatest common divisor.</p>
<h3 id="definition-2.5-coprime">Definition 2.5 (Coprime)</h3>
<p>A pair of integers <span class="math">\(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> are <em>coprime</em> (or <em>relatively prime</em>) if and only if <span class="math">\(\gcd(a,b)=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that as long as <span class="math">\(a,b\)</span> are not both zero then <span class="math">\(\gcd(a,b)\)</span> exists. This follows since all common divisors of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are bounded above by <span class="math">\(\max(|a|,|b|)\)</span> in this case, and so a greatest one exists by the well-orderedness of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span></p>
<p>In the next section we will see the Euclidean Algorithm which calculates the gcd of a pair of integers. It consists of repeatedly applying the process of <em>integer division with remainder</em>. Again, while we give a very rigorous treatment of this process here, the concept should be very familiar to you from your schoolwork with numbers.</p>
</div><div id="ntc-common-divisors-sec.-2.3-1" class="slide section level2">
<h1>NT&amp;C \\ Common divisors (sec. 2.3)</h1>
<h3 id="theorem-2.2-integer-division-with-remainder">Theorem 2.2 (Integer division with remainder)</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b \neq 0\)</span>. There exists a unique pair <span class="math">\(q,r \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\[
a = qb + r , \quad \quad 0 \leq r &lt; |b|.
\]</span></p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> See notes. Notice that it uses axiom 11 of the integers, in the form 11 b. the well ordered property.</p>
<p>We finish with a characterisation of the gcd of two integers <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> in terms of linear combinations of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="theorem-2.3-characterisation-of-greatest-common-divisor">Theorem 2.3 (Characterisation of greatest common divisor)</h3>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math">\(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> are not both zero and that <span class="math">\(d=\gcd(a,b)\)</span>. Then there exists <span class="math">\(n,m \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\[
d = ma + nb,
\]</span> and moreover any common divisor of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof</em>. Let <span class="math">\(S\)</span> be the set of all positive linear combinations of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math">\[
S = \left \{ \alpha a + \beta b \, : \, \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z} ,
 \, \alpha a + \beta b &gt; 0 \right \}.
\]</span> By the well-ordered axiom <span class="math">\(S\)</span> has a least element <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, which we can write as <span class="math">\[
0 &lt; d = ma + nb ,
\]</span> for some pair of integers <span class="math">\(m,n\)</span>. We claim that <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is a common divisor of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math">\(d\)</span> did not divide <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. Then by the integer division theorem we could write <span class="math">\[\begin{align}
&amp;a = qd + r, \quad 0 &lt; r &lt; d, \\
\Rightarrow &amp; r = a - qd , \\
&amp; = a - q(ma +nb), \text{ (from above)} \\
&amp;= (1-qm)a -qn b .
\end{align}
\]</span> So we see that <span class="math">\(r\)</span> would be a linear combination of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math">\(r \in S\)</span>. But then this would contradict the fact that <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is the least element of <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, since we have <span class="math">\(r&lt;d\)</span> above. So we conclude that <span class="math">\(d\)</span> does indeed divide <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. An argument along similar lines will show that <span class="math">\(d\)</span> also divides <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. So we can conclude that <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is a common divisor of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p>Next we see that if <span class="math">\(e\)</span> is any other common divisor of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> then <span class="math">\(e| d\)</span> by property 3 of theorem 2.1. Hence <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is the greatest common divisor and all other common divisors divide <span class="math">\(d\)</span>. <span class="math">\(\Box\)</span></p>
