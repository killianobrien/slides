<h1 id="integer-divisibility">Integer divisibility</h1>
<p>[ch:divisibility] In this chapter we introduce the divisibility relation of the integers. It accords exactly with our primary-school notions of one number <em>evenly dividing</em> another.</p>
<h2 id="divisibility">Divisibility</h2>
<p>[Divisibility] Let \(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\). We say that \(b\) <em>divides</em> \(a\) if and only if there exists an integer \(c \in \mathbb{Z}\) such that \[a = bc .\] If this is so then \(b\) and \(c\) can be referred to as <em>factors</em> or <em>divisors</em> of \(a\), and \(a\) can be referred to as a (integer) multiple of \(b\) and \(c\).</p>
<p>We write \(b | a\) to denote that \(b\) divides \(a\) and \( b \centernot | a\) to denote that it does not.</p>
<p>The integers \(1\), \(3\), \(5\) and \(15\) all divide \(15\), whereas \(10\) is not divisible by \(3\).</p>
<p>Divisibility is a relation amongst integers, i.e. it is a two-place predicate, providing values for \(a\) and \(b\) in the predicate \(a | b\) produces a statement, which may be true or false depending on the values. An important type of relation is one that behaves like the relation of equality, so called equivalence relations. These are relations that are reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Divisibility is <strong>not</strong> an equivalence relation. It is reflexive and transitive but it is not symmetric. Other important properties are outlined in the following theorem.</p>
<p>[Basic properties of divisibility] [T:divisprops] The divisibility relation enjoys the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<em>Reflexivity</em>) For all \(a \in \mathbb{Z}\), \(a | a\).</p></li>
<li><p>(<em>Transitivity</em>) For all \(a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}\), if \(a|b\) and \(b|c\) then \(a | c \).</p></li>
<li><p>[T:divlincomb] (<em>Divisibility of linear combinations</em>) For all \(a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}\), if \(a | b\) and \(a | c\) then for all \(n,m \in \mathbb{Z}\), \(a | \left ( n b + m c \right )\).</p></li>
<li><p>(<em>\(1\) divides everything</em>) For all \(a \in \mathbb{Z}\), \(1|a\).</p></li>
<li><p>(<em>everything divides \(0\)</em>) For all \(a \in \mathbb{Z}\), \(a | 0\).</p></li>
<li><p>(<em>\(0\) divides only itself</em>) For all \(a \in \mathbb{Z}\), if \(0 | a\) then \(a=0\).</p></li>
<li><p>For all \(a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}\), if \(c \neq 0\) then \(a | b\) if and only if \(ac | bc\).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The proofs of these properties all follow from one or more applications of the definition of divisibility and properties of the integers. The proofs are left as exercises.</p>
<p>Note that an integer \(z\) has exactly the same divisors as its negative \(-z\). In order to avoid duplication we normally confine our attention to the divisibility properties of the positive integers.</p>
<h2 id="primes">Primes</h2>
<p>We shall have a lot more to say about prime numbers later, but for now we give the definition and state a fundamental theorem concerning primes in the integers.</p>
<p>[Prime, Composite] An integer \(p &gt; 1\) is <em>prime</em> if it has no positive divisors other than itself and 1. An integer \(n &gt; 1\) which is not prime is called <em>composite</em>.</p>
<p>It is conventional to reserve the letter \(p\) to denote primes, so when writing mathematics in the context of number theory one should not use \(p\) to denote a composite number. Note that the integer \(1\) is considered neither prime nor composite. As we shall see as important aspect of primes is how every integer factors uniquely into a product of prime factors. Allowing \(1\) as one of these prime factors would destroy this uniqueness.</p>
<p>The list of prime numbers begins 2, 3, 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17, 19, 23, …</p>
<p>As the name suggests, an important result concerning primes is the <em>Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</em>. This will be proved later but it is worth stating it now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</strong><br><em>Every positive integer \(n\) factors into a product of primes</em> n = p<sub>1</sub><sup><sub>1</sub></sup> p<sub>2</sub><sup><sub>2</sub></sup> …p<sub>r</sub><sup><sub>r</sub></sup>, \(p_i\) prime, \(\alpha_i \in \mathbb{Z}^+\) <em>and this factorisation is unique up to the order in which the primes are written down.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people’s intuition about the integers agrees with this result and the existence of such prime factorisations can be proved now and follows by recursively applying the definition of prime/composite to \(n\) and using the transitivity of divisibility. But the proof of the uniqueness of these factorisations requires some more theory to be developed.</p>
<h2 id="common-divisors">Common divisors</h2>
<p>Relationships between the divisibility of different integers is investigated using the concept of common divisors.</p>
<p>[Common divisor] Let \(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\). An integer \(c\) is a <em>common divisor</em> of \(a\) and \(b\) if and only if \(c\) divides \(a\) and \(c\) divides \(b\).</p>
<p>[Greatest common divisor] By the well-orderedness of \(\mathbb{Z}\) there exists a <em>greatest common divisor</em> of \(a\) and \(b\). This is denoted \(\text{gcd}(a,b)\). Note that some authors use a minimalist notation of \((a,b)\) to denote the greatest common divisor.</p>
<p>[Coprime] A pair of integers \(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\) are <em>coprime</em> (or <em>relatively prime</em>) if and only if \(\gcd(a,b)=1\).</p>
<p>Note that as long as \(a,b\) are not both zero then \(\gcd(a,b)\) exists. This follows since all common divisors of \(a\) and \(b\) are bounded above by \(\max(|a|,|b|)\) in this case, and so a greatest one exists by the well-orderedness of \(\mathbb{Z}\).</p>
<p>What we seek now is a method or algorithm to obtain the greatest common divisor of two given integers \(a\) and \(b\). We can describe \(\gcd(a,b)\) in terms of the overlap in the prime factorisations of \(a\) and \(b\). But we have not yet proved the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic so this path is not available to us yet. In addition, obtaining the prime factorisations of large integers is computationally very expensive, whereas the Euclidean algorithm is not so much.</p>
<p>The method for obtaining greatest common divisors is known as Euclid’s Algorithm. It consists of repeatedly applying the process of <em>integer division with remainder</em>. Again, while we give a very rigorous treatment of this process here, the concept should be very familiar to you from your schoolwork with numbers.</p>
<p>[Integer division with remainder] [T:integerdiv] Let \(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\), \(b \neq 0\). There exists a unique pair \(q,r \in \mathbb{Z}\) such that a = qb + r , 0 r &lt; |b|.</p>
<p>First we prove the existence of such a pair \(q,r\). Consider the set \(S\) of non-negative integers of the form \(a - qb\), i.e. S = { a - tb : t Z, a - tb 0 }. Since \(b \neq 0\) adding or subtracting sufficient multiples of \(b\) from \(a\) will eventually produce positive integers, so \(S\) is non-empty. By the well-ordered axiom \(S\) contains a least element \(r=a-qb \geq 0\).</p>
<p>We claim that \(r &lt; |b|\). If this were not true then we would have</p>
<p>\[\begin{aligned*}
r &amp;= a-qb \geq |b| \\
\Rightarrow \, r - |b| &amp;= a - (q \pm 1)b \geq 0 .\end{aligned*}\]</p>
<p>This last line shows that we would have \(0 \leq r-|b| &lt; r\) and \(r-|b| \in S\). But this contradicts the fact that \(r\) is the least element in \(S\). So we can conclude that indeed \(0 \leq r &lt; |b|\) as required and so we know that the required pair \((q,r)\) exists.</p>
<p>The fact that the pair \(q,r\) is unique follows from the uniqueness of \(r\) as being the least element in \(S\). For if there were two pairs \(q_1,r_1\) and \(q_2, r_2\) satisfying the conditions of the theorem then we would have:</p>
<p>\[\begin{aligned*}
&amp; r_1=r_2, \text{ by uniqueness of least element of $S$} \\
\Rightarrow \, &amp; r_1-r_2 = (q_1 - q_2) b = 0, \\
\Rightarrow \, &amp; q_1-q_2 = 0, \text{ by the zero-divisors law, since $b \neq 0$}\end{aligned*}\]</p>
<p>and so the pair \(q,r\) is indeed unique.</p>
<p>Before describing the Euclidean Algorithm we give a characterisation of \(\gcd(a,b)\) in terms of linear combinations of \(a\) and \(b\). The proof of this uses a similar method to the proof of the integer division theorem.</p>
<p>[Characterisation of greatest common divisor][T:gcdcharac] Suppose that \(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\) are not both zero and that \(d=\gcd(a,b)\). Then there exists \(n,m \in \mathbb{Z}\) such that d = ma + nb, and moreover any common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) divides \(d\).</p>
<p>Let \(S\) be the set of all positive linear combinations of \(a\) and \(b\), i.e. S = { a + b : , Z , a + b &gt; 0 }. By the well-ordered axiom \(S\) has a least element \(d\), which we can write as 0 &lt; d = ma + nb , [E:dmn] for some pair of integers \(m,n\). We claim that \(d\) is a common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\).</p>
<p>Suppose that \(d\) did not divide \(a\). Then by the integer division theorem we could write</p>
<p>\[\begin{aligned*}
&amp;a = qd + r, \quad 0 &lt; r &lt; d, \\
\Rightarrow &amp; r = a - qd , \\
&amp; = a - q(ma +nb), \text{ (from (\ref{E:dmn}) above)} \\
&amp;= (1-qm)a -qn b .\end{aligned*}\]</p>
<p>So we see that \(r\) would be a linear combination of \(a\) and \(b\), i.e. \(r \in S\). But then this would contradict the fact that \(d\) is the least element of \(S\), since we have \(r&lt;d\) above. So we conclude that \(d\) does indeed divide \(a\). An argument along similar lines will show that \(d\) also divides \(b\). So we can conclude that \(d\) is a common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\).</p>
<p>Next we see that if \(e\) is any other common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) then \(e| d\) by property 3 of theorem [T:divisprops]. Hence \(d\) is the greatest common divisor and all other common divisors divide \(d\).</p>
<p>The following are consequences of the recently introduced definitions and results along with previous results on divisibility.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Let \(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\) be not both zero. Consider the sets \(A\) and \(B\) defined by A= { ma + nb : m,n Z }, B = { m (a,b) : m Z }. Show that \(A=B\), i.e. linear combinations of \(a\) and \(b\) correspond exactly with multiples of \(\gcd(a,b)\).</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime if and only if there exists \(m,n \in \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(ma + nb =1\).</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(d=\gcd(a,b)\) and that \(a=\alpha d\) and \(b = \beta d\). Prove that \(\gcd(\alpha, \beta)=1\).</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that if \(\gcd(a,b)=d\) then \(\gcd \left ( \frac{a}{d}, \frac{b}{d} \right ) = 1\).</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(a|c\) and \(b|c\) and \(\gcd(a,b)=1\). Prove that \(ab|c\).</p></li>
<li><p>(Euclid’s Lemma). Suppose that \(c|ab\) and that \(\gcd(c,a)=1\). Prove that \(c|b\).</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-euclidean-algorithm">The Euclidean algorithm</h2>
<p>We start with a lemma that describes how integer division with remainder relates to greatest common divisors of the divisee, divisor and remainder.</p>
<p>[L:eucalg] If \(a=qb+r\) then the common divisors of \(a\) and \(b\) are exactly the common divisors of \(b\) and \(r\), in particular (a,b) = (b,r) .</p>
<p>The Euclidean Algorithm works by exploiting this lemma. If we are trying to find \(\gcd(a,b)\) (assume that \(a \geq b\)) then we can perform the integer division step and then we know that \(\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(b,r)\) and moreover the pair \(b,r\) is <em>smaller</em> than the pair \(a,b\). By repeating this procedure we will eventually reach a pair of integers, small enough so that their gcd is obvious. Before describing the algorithm in general we will give an example which shows all the details.</p>
<p>Find \(\gcd(525,90)\).</p>
<p>[Solution]</p>
<p>\[\begin{aligned*}
525 &amp; = 5 \times 90 + 75 , \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gcd(525,90)=\gcd(90,75), 
\label{E:gcdeq02}\\
90 &amp; = 1 \times 75 + \underline{15}, \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gcd(90,75)=\gcd(75,15),
\label{E:gcdeq01}\\
75 &amp; = 5 \times 15 + 0, \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gcd(75,15)=\gcd(15,0) = 15.\end{aligned*}\]</p>
<p>Combining the gcd equations shows that \(\gcd(525,90)=15\). We notice that we repeat the integer divisions until we reach a remainder of zero. The last non-zero remainder obtained is the greatest common divisor of the original pair \(a,b\).</p>
<p>In addition to finding the gcd, the algorithm also provides the linear combination referred to in theorem [T:gcdcharac]. This is found by working through the integer division equations backwards, starting with the second-last one, i.e. the one featuring the gcd as the remainder. We then work our way back through the equations until we have the gcd \(d\) expressed as a linear combination of the initial \(a\) and \(b\).</p>
<p>\[\begin{aligned*}
\underline{15} &amp; = 90 - 1 \times 75, \text{ from eq. (\ref{E:gcdeq01})}\\
&amp;= 90 - (525 - 5 \times 90), \text{ from eq. (\ref{E:gcdeq02})}\\
&amp;= -1 \times 525 + 6 \times 90.\end{aligned*}\]</p>
<p>We give another, slightly longer example, before describing the process in general.</p>
<p>Find \(\gcd(12378, 3054)\).</p>
<p>[Solution]</p>
<p>\[\begin{aligned*}
12378 &amp;= 4 \times 3054 + 162 , \\
3054 &amp;= 18 \times 162 + 138, \\
162 &amp;= 1 \times 138 + 24 ,\\
138 &amp;= 5 \times 24 + 18 , \label{E:gcdeq04}\\
24 &amp;= 1 \times 18 + \underline{6}, \label{E:gcdeq03}\\
18 &amp;= 3 \times 6 + 0.\end{aligned*}\]</p>
<p>So \(\gcd(12378,3054) = 6\). Working backwards, as described in the previous example, will eventually produce 6 as a linear combination of 12378 and 3054.</p>
<p>\[\begin{aligned*}
6 &amp;= 24 - 18 , \text{ from eq. (\ref{E:gcdeq03})} \\
&amp;= 24 - (138 - 5 \times 24), \text{ from eq. (\ref{E:gcdeq04})}\\
&amp;= 6 \times 24 - 138 , \\
&amp;= 6 \times (162 - 138) - 138 , \\
&amp;= 6 \times 162 - 7 \times 138 ,\\
&amp; \vdots \\
&amp;= 132 \times 12378 - 535 \times 3054,\end{aligned*}\]</p>
<p>which is the desired linear combination.</p>
<p>[Euclidean Algorithm] The following procedure is an algorithm for determining \(\gcd(a,b)\) and obtaining the integer coefficients \(m,n\) for an expression (a,b) = ma + nb . We assume that \(a \geq b &gt; 0\) (this is sufficient for the general case by earlier comments). Consider the sequence of integer divisions that are carried out until a remainder of zero is obtained:</p>
<p>\[\begin{aligned*}
a &amp; = q_1 b + r_1 , \quad 0 &lt; r_1 &lt; b \\
b &amp;= q_2 r_1 + r_2, \quad 0 &lt; r_2 &lt; r_1 \\
r_1 &amp;= q_3 r_2 + r_3 , \quad 0 &lt; r_3 &lt; r_2 \\
 &amp; \, \, \, \vdots \nonumber \\
 r_{n-2} &amp;= q_n r_{n-1} + r_n , \quad 0 &lt; r_n &lt; r_{n-1} \label{E:gcdeq05}\\
 r_{n-1} &amp;=q_{n+1} r_n .\end{aligned*}\]</p>
<p>The last non-zero remainder \(r_n\) obtained in these equations is the required greatest common divisor \(r_n=gcd(a,b)\).</p>
<p>From eq ([E:gcdeq05]) we get an expression for \(r_n\) as a linear combination of \(r_{n-1}\) and \(r_{n-2}\), r<sub>n</sub> = r<sub>n-2</sub> - q<sub>n</sub> r<sub>n-1</sub> . Working backwards through these equations we replace each intermediate remainder \(r_j\) (\(1 \leq j &lt; n\)) with linear combinations of earlier remainders until we arrive at a linear combination for \(r_n\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\), as required.</p>
<p>The justification for the conclusions of the algorithm follow from theorem [T:integerdiv] and lemma [L:eucalg]. The fact that the algorithm will terminate (i.e. stop after a finite number of steps) follows from the fact that the remainders \(r_i\) constitute a strictly decreasing sequence of non-negative integers and hence this sequence must arrive at zero after a finite number of steps.</p>
<p>An immediate application of the Euclidean Algorithm gives a proof of the following result.</p>
<p>If \(m\) is a positive integer then (ma,mb) = m (a,b), (where \(a,b\) are not both zero).</p>
<p>This follows immediately from observing that the sequence of integer divisions that come about from applying the Euclidean Algorithm to the pair \(ma,mb\) are simply the equations from applying the algorithm to the pair \(a,b\), but multiplied through by \(m\). For instance, [ a=q<sub>1</sub> b + r<sub>1</sub>, (0 r<sub>1</sub> &lt; b) ] [ma = q<sub>1</sub> mb + m r<sub>1</sub>, (0 m r<sub>1</sub> &lt; mb) ] .</p>
<p>So if \(\gcd(a,b) = r_n\), the final non-zero remainder, then \(\gcd(ma,mb) = m r_n\), as required.</p>
<p>Related to the concept of the greatest common divisor is that of the least common multiple.</p>
<p>[Least common multiple] Let \(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\) be both non-zero. The <em>least common multiple</em>, \(\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)\), is the smallest positive integer that is a both a multiple of \(a\) and a multiple of \(b\).</p>
<p>There is a direct relationship between the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of a pair of integers.</p>
<p>[T:gcdlcm] If \(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\) are both positive then (a,b) (a,b) = ab.</p>
<p>Let \(d=\gcd(a,b)\). We prove the result directly by showing that the quantity \(\frac{ab}{d}\) is equal to \(\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)\).</p>
<p>Since \(d\) divides \(a\) and \(b\) there exist \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}\) such that a= d , b = d, and so abd = b d= a d. This shows that \(\frac{ab}{d}\) is a positive common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\). Now we show it is the least such one. Suppose that \(c\) is another common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\), say c = a = b , (, Z). Now since \(d=\gcd(a,b)\) we know there are \(m,n \in \mathbb{Z}\) such that d = ma + nb . Now we examine the quantity \(c\) divided by the integer \(\frac{ab}{d}\), cabd = cdab = c (ma + nb)ab = cb m + ca n = m + n . This last expression shows that \(c\) divided by the integer \(\frac{ab}{d}\) , is an integer, or in other words, \(\frac{ab}{d}\) divides \(c\) and hence \(\frac{ab}{d} \leq c\) as required.</p>
<p>Here are some questions to help you practice using the Euclidean Algorithm. You should complete these and others until you are confident in using it to find both the gcd and a linear combination for the gcd. It is good practice to make a few notes as you go emphasizing how the pairs we apply the integer division process to all have the same gcd, by lemma [L:eucalg].</p>
