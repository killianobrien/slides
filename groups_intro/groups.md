# The unit


* Taught by Dr Killian O'Brien + ...
* 2 hours lecture + 1 hour tutorial per week
* Coursework problems (40%), Examination (60%)
* New unit: introduced in response to student requests for more pure mathematics content


# Nature of the unit

* A thorough introduction to a substantial area of pure mathematics that has strong connections to areas of geometry, combinatorics, graph theory, ... .
* Definately suited to students who like problem solving and the unit will develop your skills in this area.
* We will use the Sage mathematics system to aid our investigations. You will also get an introduction to the Python programming language.  ([www.sagemath.org](http://www.sagemath.org), [cloud.sagemath.org](https://cloud.sagemath.org), [sagecell.sagemath.org](https://sagecell.sagemath.org))

# What you will get from the unit

* An appreciation for the many aspects of group theory and its connections to other areas of mathematics.
* Development of your problem solving and abstract thinking skills.
* Exposure to SageMath mathematical software, aimed at pure mathematics teaching and research.
* SageMath uses the Python programming language which is widely used in many areas of computing.

# What is a group?

A set of mathematical objects with a mathematically meaningful operation applied amongst them, as long as it is *well behaved*, it will be a group. It's a very broad concept and present in many areas of mathematics.

## More formally

A set $G$ with a binary operation $\star$ satisfying

* $G$ is a closed system under $\star$, i.e. $x \star y \in G$.
* $\star$ is associative on $G$, i.e. $x \star ( y \star z) = (x \star y) \star z$.
* $G$ contains an identity element, $e$, for $\star$, i.e. $x \star e = e \star x = x$.
* $G$ contains inverse elements for $\star$, i.e. $x \star x^{-1} = e$.

# Syllabus topics

## Examples of groups:

* Symmetry groups of two and three-dimensional objects,
* the dihedral groups $D_n$,
* rotational symmetry groups of three-dimensional polyhedra.
* Permutation groups, the Symmetric groups $S_n$ and the Alternating groups $A_n$.
* Number based groups under arithmetic operations,
* the cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_n$.
* Groups of matrices.
* ...

# Visualising the elements of $\Gamma^+(T)$

$\Gamma^+(T)$ is the set of rotational symmetries of the tetrahedron.

# The Symmetric group, $S_4$, on four objects

$S_4$ is the group of all rearrangments, or *permutations*, of four objects.

Various concept definitions and examples, including: elements, orders, Abelian groups, subgroups, generators and cyclic/non-cyclic. The natural mappings between groups, homomorphisms and isomorphisms. Examples of isomorphic pairs and non-isomorphic pairs. Cayley's theorem: Every group isomorphic to a group of permutations.

# Syllabus topics

## Classification problems:

What are the grand enterprises of group theory? What classification problems can be posed?

## The Monster group

* A group, $M$, with approx. $8 \times 10^{53}$ elements, that is *simple*, i.e. it has no *normal* subgroups.
* $M$ is (isomorphic to) a group of rotations of 196883-dimensional space.
* $M$ is (isomorphic to) a group of matrices generated by two particular binary $196882 \times 196882$ matrices.

G=DihedralGroup(12)
# G is the group of rotational and
# reflectional symmetries of the
# regular 12-sided polygon

HH = G.subgroups()
# HH is the set of all subgroups of G

# The following for loop prints the
# Cayley graph of each subgroup of G
for H in HH:
    show(H.cayley_graph())
</code></pre>

The above code displays the *Cayley Graph* of every subgroup of $D_{12}$.
