- Plenty of positive comments from students during the course and in ISS
	- very appreciative of this extra revision/catch-up resource
- Some quibbles about:
	- no visualiser video
	- missing recordings / very occasional gremlins

I did emphasize experimental / proof of concept nature of the enterprise to guard against such comments

- Requires minimal extra effort, so why not? Students like them.
- Occasionally useful to myself for self-evaluation. 
- Maybe a negative affect on attendance?
	- put this down to student mis-use?
- A distraction from better things?
	- watching videos is a poor substitute for reading and doing mathematics, i.e. directly engaging the mind with these abstract concepts.

### What do you think?

- any questions
- your own reflections and experience
- technical points
