## What the students see

- Go to a [Moodle area](http://moodle.mmu.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=34993)
- Link from there to a [Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/116980035472158807129/posts) 
- On the G+ page there is a chronological list of the lectures as Hangout recordings with extra info posted in comments below
    - dropbox links to scanned visualizer pages
    - weblinks to online code snippets
    - links to any other resources ...  

Links to the G+ pages for my lectures:
    
- [Mathematics Fundamentals](https://plus.google.com/116980035472158807129/posts), Level 4
- [Analyticall Methods](https://plus.google.com/108585842013332383095/posts), Level 5

## What are Google Hangouts?

- Google+ &#x2248; Facebook
- Hangouts (Google) &#x2248; Skype (Microsoft) <img width=400 align="right" src=figures/me_hangout.png>
- [Hangouts on Air](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/onair) are hangouts that 
    - are broadcast
    - are uploaded and recorded **in real-time** to youtube channel of G+ page
    - can 'share screen' instead of webcam
    - can have up to 10 live participants for meetings, seminars etc

# What the lecturer does
## Before term

- Set up G+ page and YouTube channel for unit
- Put links to these in Moodle area
- Get familiar with **doing** a Hangout on Air

## My typical lecture

- Log in to PC and open needed tabs in browser and/or other applications
- Initiate the Hangout on Air
- Do the lecture
- Log off PC

## After lecture

- Stop by an MFP (multifunctional printer) and scan any handwritten visualizer pages
- Save the pdf from email to Dropbox
- Paste Dropbox share link to comments section on G+ page
- Add any follow up links

- Plenty of positive comments from students during the course and in ISS
	- very appreciative of this extra revision/catch-up resource
- Some quibbles about:
	- no visualiser video
	- missing recordings / very occasional gremlins

I did emphasize experimental / proof of concept nature of the enterprise to guard against such comments

# Reflections

<img width=350 align="right" src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Nuta_CQvImI/TA2NNS9tjtI/AAAAAAAAB5M/CCfv28odS6s/s1600/The-Thinker-by-Auguste-Rodin.jpg>

- Requires minimal extra effort, so why not? Students like them.
- Occasionally useful to myself for self-evaluation. 
- Maybe a negative affect on attendance?
	- put this down to student mis-use?
- A distraction from better things?
	- watching videos is a poor substitute for reading and doing mathematics, i.e. directly engaging the mind with these abstract concepts.

## What do you think?

- any questions
- your own reflections and experience
- technical points
