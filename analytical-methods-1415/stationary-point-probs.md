## Stationary point problems

1. Consider the function, $f$, of two variables, defined by 
$$ f(x,y)=\left ( x^2 - 9 \right ) \sin (y).$$
Find all the stationary points of $f$ and classify each of them as either a local maximum, local minimum or a saddle point. For each of these types of stationary point that you find, choose one example point and use MATLAB to generate surface plots of portions of the surface defined by $z=f(x,y)$ that clearly show the nature of the stationary point.

2. Consider the function $g$, of two variables, defined by 
$$g(x,y)=x \cos(xy).$$
Prove that $g$ has no stationary points.

3. (Schaum's *Calculus* Chap. 52) Show that the rectangular parallelepiped of maximum volume $V$ having fixed surface area $S$ is a cube.
